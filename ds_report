Key Insights: Trader Behavior & Market Sentiment

Trader Decisions Reflect Market Mood
BUY orders dominate, especially on Greed days, suggesting traders follow bullish sentiment, while Fear days see cautious, smaller trades.

Profit Isn’t Just Volume
High-frequency trading in certain coins doesn’t always yield higher PnL. Strategic, selective trades often outperform sheer trade count.

Time Matters
Most profitable trades occur between 20:00–23:00 IST and weekends show higher average PnL despite fewer trades, indicating strategic timing improves outcomes.

Market Sentiment Influences Risk & Reward
Extreme Fear reduces profitability, while Greed encourages larger trades and higher potential gains, highlighting a clear link between psychology and trader behavior.

Outliers Drive Impact
A few high-risk trades cause large swings in PnL, emphasizing that risk management is critical for consistent performance.

Lagged Sentiment Effects
Yesterday’s Fear & Greed values slightly influence today’s PnL, suggesting that market psychology can predict short-term trading outcomes.
